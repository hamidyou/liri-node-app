# liri-node-app

## Prompt
In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Get Started
- download the repo
- create a `.env` file with the following (you will need to register with Spotify and create a developer account to get your own spotify id & secret) https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/login
```
# Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=[YOUR_SPOTIFY_ID]
SPOTIFY_SECRET=[YOUR_SPOTIFY_SECRET]
```
- Once downloaded and the `.env` is created, open the terminal, navigate to the folder of your project and run.
  - node liri.js
- Select one of the 4 options:
  - `spotify-this-song`
    - returns artist, song title, preview link, and album name
  - `concert-this`
    - returns artist & concert venue, location, and date
  - `movie-this`
    - returns movie title, year of release, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes ratings, countries of release, languages, plot, and actors
  - `do-what-it-says`
    - runs the command and title in the random.txt file
